      "Can ChatGPT Write Better SQL than a Data Analyst? | by Marie Truong | Towards Data Science Open in app Sign up Sign In Write Sign up Sign In Member-only story Can ChatGPT Write Better SQL than a Data Analyst? Marie Truong · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 6 min read · Jan 5 -- 86 Share Photo by  DeepMind  on  Unsplash I tried  ChatGPT , a variant of the GPT-3 language model that is specifically designed for generating human-like text in a conversational context. And of course, like most of us, I wondered: can an AI do my job? And can it do it better than me? I have 2 years of experience working as a Data Analyst and an Analytics Engineer. According to  BBC Science Focus , ChatGPT has ingested 570 GB of data. So who writes better SQL? Let’s play! This game will be based on 3 LeetCode SQL challenges (one easy, two medium). I will write every solution first, and then send the exercise to ChatGPT and see which solution works best. I will provide links to every challenge so you can try as well to beat ChatGPT. Challenge 1 (Easy) This challenge is called  Customer placing the largest number of orders . Screenshot by Author Here is the query I wrote: WITH layer_1 AS (   SELECT      customer_number, COUNT(DISTINCT order_number) AS order_number   FROM orders   GROUP BY customer_number ) SELECT customer_number  FROM layer_1 ORDER BY order_number DESC  LIMIT 1 It passed with a correct runtime: Screenshot by Author Now let’s see how ChatGPT performs on this one. Here is what ChatGPT answered: Screenshot by Author ChatGPT even explains what it did. I don’t find the query very readable — one of the reasons why I love common table expressions is readability — but let’s see how it performs. -- -- 86 Follow Written by  Marie Truong 2.1K Followers · Writer for  Towards Data Science Analytics Engineer @Scopely | Python | SQL Follow More from  Marie Truong  and Towards Data Science Marie Truong in Towards Data Science How to Build an ELT with Python Extracting, Loading and Transforming Data · 7 min read · Feb 7 -- 6 Miriam Santos in Towards Data Science Pandas 2.0: A Game-Changer for Data Scientists?
